                We are <strong>Group 2</strong> from the <em>CS371 Course</em> at Gettysburg College. This project showcases our progress in solving line following problems using the PiCar-X2 from SunFounder.
            </p>
            <p>After 13 meetings, our robot can now:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow a continuous line smoothly</li>
                <li>Reacquire the line after a 90-degree turn (left and right)</li>
                <li>Detect intersections and decide whether to turn or go straight</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Some Challenges We Faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficulty connecting the robot to Raspberry Pi software on personal laptops</li>
            <li>Reliance on a desktop setup due to connection issues</li>
            <li>Robot head broke and required replacement</li>
            <li>Previous groupâ€™s code was missing or inaccessible</li>
            <li>Mistakenly altered SD card, disabling SSH and VNC</li>
            <li>Remote connection setup was delayed and complex</li>
            <li>Robot exhibited jittering due to improper zeroing and calibration</li>
            <li>Sensor thresholds for black/white detection were misconfigured initially</li>
            <li>Robot movement calibration caused it to veer off course</li>
            <li>Left turns were inconsistent and overshot the line</li>
            <li>Robot had trouble re-aligning with the line after turns</li>
            <li>Early intersection detection logic was unreliable</li>
            <li>Robot defaulted to right turns, with no randomization</li>
            <li>Intersections were occasionally missed despite improvements</li>
        </ul>
