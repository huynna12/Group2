            <li><strong>Line-Following:</strong> Implement robot line-following that will follow a line through sudden turns up to 90 degrees.</li>
            <li><strong>Intersection-Finding:</strong> Implement robot line-following that will follow a line as in (1), but stop when it comes to an intersection of two or more lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Intersection-Choosing:</strong> Implement robot line-following that will, beyond (1) and (2), exit the intersection at the nth spoke clockwise from the line it travelled.</li>
            <li><strong>Intersection-Traversing:</strong> Implement robot line-following that will perform (3) in succession given n1, n2, n3, ...</li>
            <li><strong>Search and Traverse:</strong> Implement robot line-following that, given a graph topology, its current intersection and heading, and its goal intersection and heading, will generate a sequence of moves and perform (4).</li>
            <li><strong>Localize, Search, and Traverse:</strong> Implement robot line-following that, given all that is given in (4) except its current intersection and heading, will take action to ascertain its state (localize), and then perform (5).</li>
            <li><strong>Explore, Search, and Traverse:</strong> Implement robot line-following that explores lines and intersections, forms a graph roadmap, and navigates to a graph intersection with the following property: Let d(i,j) be the minimum number of edges to travel to get from intersection i to intersection j. Let D(i) be max(d(i,j)) for all j. A goal intersection has the minimum D(i).</li>
